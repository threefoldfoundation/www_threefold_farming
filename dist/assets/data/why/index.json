Blockchain and edge computing were only steps towards that end goal. Our model removes complexity and inefficiencies. No intermediaries. No marketing. No gimmicks. Everything is automated. Completely end-to-end. But it doesn't end there. Users get full control over their data with 100% security and privacy. Not even ThreeFold can access it.</p>\n","image":"peer-to-peer.png","order":6},{"id":"availability","title":"An Internet available to everyone","content":"<p>As of today, about 50% of the world's population is connected to the Internet. This statistic shows a great digital divide that is present in our current world, depsite Internet access being a human right. For us, at ThreeFold, this is not acceptable as the Internet today represents access to extent information, knowledge and economic opportunities.

Most of that power is used to cool down servers that are stacked in large data centers. But this wouldn't be needed in a decentralized model like the ThreeFold Grid. The testing of ThreeFold's Internet infrastructure showed that we could enable between 50 &#x26; 99% power savings, while providing better uptime performance to users.</p>\n","image":"sustainability.png","order":4}],"cards":[],"contactData":[],"header":{"title":"BE THE INTERNET","subtitle":"The world needs a Technological Reset","excerpt":"The Internet is run by large corporations and their hyper-scale data centers.
