Farming is connecting a 3Node (server-type hardware) in your home or office, that way empowering your city, village, or community with a data sovereign and planet positive Internet infrastructure that can host the data of millions of people and earn you income in [TFT](https://threefold.io/token).
<br/>
<br/>

3Nodes are powered by ThreeFold’s open source operating system Zero-OS, and can host the data and workloads of thousands of people. When providing Internet capacity to the People's Internet, you are rewarded with TFT. And thanks to our proof-of-capacity model, your 3Node does all the heavy lifting for you.
