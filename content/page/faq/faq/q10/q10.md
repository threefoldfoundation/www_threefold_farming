question: Which 3Node options are best for non-technical people? (Plug & Play)
---

If you are non-technical, we highly recommend you to get a Plug-and-Play 3Node on the ThreeFold Website or with one of our Farming Cooperatives. Plug-and-Play [3Node](https://threefold.io/farming/get_3node) are already booted by ThreeFold's operating system - Zero-OS, so all you have to do is to connect it to electricity and network and you're good to go.
<br/>
<br/>

Once connected, all you will have to do is download Threefold Connect and register your 3Node to a Farm ID. The Plug & Play node will come with the necessary instructions. Follow the step-by-step process and you should be running in 2 min.
