question: Can we have multiple 3Nodes in the same household?
---

Running multiple 3Nodes in the same household is possible, however your connection will be heavily influenced by this.
<br/>
<br/>
Putting more than 1 3Node behind a typical consumer grade internet connection (100 mbps download / 10 mbps upload) will make your connection overloaded and that will have effect on a quality of capacity you provide (something we will grade in the future) this will impact usage for third parties.
<br/>
<br/>
When behind a more rigid connection e.g. a good fiber connection, running multiple 3Nodes at once should be fairly easy to do.
