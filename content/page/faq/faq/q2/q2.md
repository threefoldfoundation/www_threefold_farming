question: What is the 3Node?
---

Any Intel or AMD (the world's 2 most famous hardware chips) server-like hardware can be turned into a 3Node. It was important for ThreeFold to enable different entry points and to maximize the reach across today's industry and allow anyone to find their most suitable settings to join the ThreeFold Grid.

A 3Node can be as small as a shoe box or as big as a data-center rack, allowing people to add Internet capacity anywhere, whether in their home office, as well as in small data centers, empowering their cities, villages and communities with a data sovereign and planet positive Internet infrastructure that can host the data of millions of people and earn income in TFT - ThreeFold's official digital currency.
