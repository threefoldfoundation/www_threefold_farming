question: Should I as a farmer sell my own capacity, or is ThreeFold doing that?
---

To promote the utilization of the ThreeFold Grid's Internet capacity, we created a mechanism that is called "cultivation". 
<br/>
<br/>

Cultivation is meant to incentivise sales channels to promote the Threefold Grid's Internet capacity and earn TFT for it. 
<br/>
<br/>

When a user utilizes a farmer's capacity, the transaction is distributed as follows:
- 10% of the utilization fee is rewarded to Farmers. 
- 25% gets burnt to ensure scarcity of TFT in the new Internet economy.
- 5% goes to the Foundation for promotional purposes.
- 60% is used to reward the sales channels.
<br/>
<br/>

If the Farmer sells the capacity of their 3Nodes themselves, they will benefit from the 60% sales channel reward on top of the 10% utilization reward.
