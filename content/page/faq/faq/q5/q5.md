question: What do I need to do to become a Farmer?
---

All you need to become a farmer is a 3Node, electricity and network connection. 
<br/>
<br/>

There are two ways to get a 3Node: 
- by purchasing a Plug & Play 3Node
- by building your own (DIY)
<br/>
<br/>

The ThreeFold Foundation and ThreeFold Farming Cooperatives around the world are providing Plug & Play 3Nodes that are already booted by Zero-OS, permitting anyone to just order and connect a 3Node to the Threefold Grid without the need for technical knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>

Nevertheless almost any reasonably modern 64-bit computer with an Intel or AMD processor, running ThreeFold’s Zero OS can be turned into a 3Node. The team has had some success testing ARM based devices as well, and that can be expected as another option in the future.
