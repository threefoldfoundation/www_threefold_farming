The amount of TFT earned by Farmers depending on the amount of Internet capacity they provide to the ThreeFold Grid. The validation of their contribution is done by ThreeFold’s unique algorithm called Proof-of-Capacity (PoC).

To participate in PoC, hardware needs to be booted by ThreeFold’s open source operating system - Zero OS. Once installed, their Internet capacity is automatically detected by ThreeFold’s Blockchain Database. Every month, Farmers are rewarded for keeping the Internet capacity online.
