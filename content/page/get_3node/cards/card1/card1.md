Zero-OS has been designed from the bottom up, started from scratch from a Linux kernel. It is a stateless and scalable operating system with a lightweight architecture that makes it  cost and energy-efÔ¨Åcient. Zero-OS eliminates multiple layers of complexity, enabling the delivery compute and storage everywhere, much closer to the source of the hardware.
